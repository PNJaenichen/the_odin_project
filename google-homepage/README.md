The first 'large' project assigned for The Odin Project is a simple recreation of the Google Homepage. As they put it "the simple one with just a search box". 

The Google logo was taken from here: https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png

A cached page of the home page used for reference is here: https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/

Tools used were Visual Studio Code on Xubuntu using the Live Server extension.
